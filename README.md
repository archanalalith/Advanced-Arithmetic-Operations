 Advanced Arithmetic Operations  

This project is my **second Python assignment** completed as part of the **Django Learning Program at Entri Elevate**.  
It focuses on performing **various arithmetic operations** through user input and decision-making using conditional statements.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The program allows users to enter two numbers and select an operation from a given list.  
It then performs the chosen arithmetic operation and displays the result.  
Invalid choices are handled gracefully with a clear message.  

### 💡 Operations Supported  
- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  
- 🧩 Modulus  
- 🔢 Floor Division  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced  
This assignment helped me strengthen my understanding of:  
- Variables and data input using `input()`  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Arithmetic and logical operations  
- Error handling and validation  
- Code readability and structured output
